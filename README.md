# ðŸ’¾ Using the Database

To use the MySQL database provided with this project, follow these steps:

### Install MySQL Server:

- If you haven't already installed MySQL Server on your system, download and install it from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

### Create a New Database:

- Once MySQL Server is installed, open MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client tool of your choice.

- Create a new database named `library` using the following SQL command:
``sql
- CREATE DATABASE library;

## Import Database Schema and Sample Data:

- In the MySQL client tool, navigate to the `library.sql` file provided in the repository.

- Execute the SQL script to create the necessary tables and populate them with sample data:
``sql

- SOURCE /path/to/library.sql;
- Replace /path/to/library.sql with the absolute path to the library.sql file on your system.

## Verify Database Setup:

- Once the SQL script is executed successfully, verify that the library database contains the following tables:

- admin table
- books table
- staffs table

## Update Database Connection Details:

- Open the DBConnection.java file in the project.

- Modify the connection details (such as hostname, port, username, and password) to match your MySQL server configuration.

## Run the Application:

- Follow the instructions provided in the previous section to run the Library Management System application.

## Login with Admin Credentials:

- Upon launching the application, use the following credentials to log in as an admin:

- Username: admin
- Password: admin

By following these steps, you can set up the MySQL database required for the Library Management System application and ensure seamless integration with the Java Swing interface.
